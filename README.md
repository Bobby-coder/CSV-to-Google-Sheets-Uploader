## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bobby-coder/CSV-to-Google-Sheets-Uploader.git
   cd CSV-to-Google-Sheets-Uploader
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server

   Navigate to the client folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   Navigate to the server folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Configure your .env files in server with necessary variables:

   - PORT
   - CLIENT_ID
   - CLIENT_SECRET
   - REDIRECT_URI

   Create a web project in Google Cloud Console and obtain the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REDIRECT_URI.

   Add the following scopes in your project:

   Google Sheets API scope: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"

   Google Drive API scope: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"

   Enable Google Sheets API and Google Drive API in your Google Cloud Console project.

   Add your Gmail address in the test users section of the Google Cloud Console project to connect your account correctly.

   Note: Until your Google Cloud Console project is verified, you can only use test users.

4. Run the app

   Start the client (frontend):

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   Start the server (backend):

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run start
   ```

     - **Password**: `dummy@999`
   - Note: Only test users mentioned in Bobby Sadhwani's Google Cloud Console are allowed to connect. Because this Google Cloud Console project is not verified.

2. **Upload CSV File**:

   - The app will fetch and parse the file, displaying the data in a paginated table.

3. **View and Verify Data**:

6. **Disconnect Your Google Account**:
   - To disconnect, click the **"Disconnect Google"** button.

## **Notes**

- Since this app uses Bobby Sadhwani's Google Cloud Console (which is not verified), only authorized test accounts can connect. Use the provided credentials to test the app.

## **Future Enhancements**
